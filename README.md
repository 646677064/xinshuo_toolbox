# Computer Vision & Machine Learning & Algorithm Toolbox
A structured toolbox for mostly (learning-based and geometry-based) computer vision and machine learning (deep learning) related algorithm. For convenience, it also contains some basic algorithm, file io, image & video processing and some help function for debuging in python, matlab, c++ and lua.

#### Usage:

*1. clone the github repository recursively including xinshuo_toolbox.*
~~~shell
git clone https://github.com/xinshuoweng/xinshuo_toolbox
~~~

*2. install dependency for the toolbox.*
~~~shell
cd xinshuo_toolbox
pip install requirements.txt
~~~

#### Example Usage:


#### Limitation:

*1. Only sequential model is supported right now. More operation for constructing the graph will be added depended on demand.*<br>
*2. Only basic layers (Convolution, Pooling, Activation, Dense) are supported right now. More layers will be added in the future.*<br>
*3. Add prototxt parse function in the future.*<br>
